(1, 'What is Professionalism?', 'Much is spoken about behaving professionally. Most people can actively recognise professionalism or the lack of it in others, but find it extremely difficult to define it, or model it when considering their own behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo lets unpick exactly what we mean by professionalism.\r\n\r\nThink about the people you respect most because they are the consummate professional. Can you identify the elements that made them so good? \r\n\r\nI\'ve asked this question of so many groups of people and the replies have included the following:\r\n\r\n* A good role model for others including, their behaviour, attitude and relationships\r\n* Good Time Keepers - always in before time, uses time well\r\n* Dresses appropriately for the role\r\n* Speaks in a way which is appropriate to each different audience without being patronising or putting people down.\r\n* Knowledgeable about the job, organization, etc.\r\n*Good with people \r\n*Communicate effectively, whatever the circumstances - actively listens \r\n*Manages their time well\r\n*Works well under pressure\r\n*Fulfils deadlines\r\n*Prioritises effectively - Is prepared to put in the time and effort to get things done, but also manages to have a reasonable work life balance\r\n*Is accountable and takes responsibility for what they do and say, and for what they leave undone\r\n\r\nLook more deeply into the issue of professionalism and you begin to realise that professionalism includes all of those strands above but also so much more. \r\n\r\nThose who are thoroughly professional, demonstrate a rounded personality. They are able to act as a good role model for their colleagues. They have the ability to take the rough with the smooth, and are always consistent with others whatever their personal circumstance or problems may be. They never take their frustrations out on others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experienced professional behaves appropriately in all situations:\r\nThey know when it is appropriate to have a laugh over a coffee and when to behave formally. They are able to run effective meetings. They are well versed in when to speak out and when to bite their tongue. They do not feel the need to be seen to be always right or stand on their dignity. They are prepared to play the long game and wait for time and experience to prove their point. They do not dodge the issues but tackle them without aggression or anger. They can always say hand on heart \"I expect high standards from my team and I demonstrate the same high standards at all times\".\r\nThe consummate professional demonstrates a generosity of spirit, there is no need for their own ego to take centre stage, they allow the credit to be taken where it is deserved. \r\n\r\nThe professional person is open to the views of others and the possibility that there might be a better way. They make decisions based on the best interest of the organisation. They are fair and even handed to all people even those they do not particularly like. The professional evaluates their own performance, has high expectations of themselves and others and constantly strives to improve.\r\n\r\nProfessionals see them selves as part of the solution rather than the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you are keen to succeed in any business you need to demonstrate the appropriate levels of professionalism. If you want promotion in the future start to demonstrate that you have the potential to fulfil that role. Just wanting the job, the title, status and financial reward is simply not enough. \r\n\r\nShow your commitment, your ability to come up with the goods, others will begin to notice and it will hold you in good stead whether you go for an internal promotion or need a reference for an external promotion. \r\n\r\nYou will also gain a huge amount of personal satisfaction in knowing you have what it takes to be a great professional.', 'www.graduatesolutions.co.uk\r\nwww.recoveringworkaholics.com\r\nginagardiner.articlealley.com', 'Education'),
(2, 'Credit Card - Advantages and Disadvantages', 'A credit card can be an asset to your lifestyle, but if not handled carefully it can become a liability, especially if you find it so convenient and easy to use that you lose control of your spending.\r\n\r\nThis short guide will help you understand how you can use your credit card so it works to your advantage, not against you.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nA credit card can:\r\n\r\n1. Offer free use of funds, provided you always pay your balance in full, on time.\r\n2. Be more convenient to carry than cash.\r\n3. Help you establish a good credit history. \r\n4. Provide a convenient payment method for purchases made on the Internet and over the telephone.\r\n5. Give you incentives, such as reward points, that you can redeem.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages\r\nOn the other hand, credit cards can:\r\n\r\n1. Cost much more than other forms of credit, such as a line of credit or a personal loan, if you don\'t pay on time.\r\n2. Damage your credit rating if your payments are late;\r\n3. Allow you to build up more debt than you can handle; \r\n4. Have complicated terms and conditions; \r\n\r\nWhat is a credit card?\r\nA credit card is more then a simple piece of plastic, it is first and foremost a flexible payment tool accepted at 30 million locations worldwide, and if the card balance is paid off every month, then no interest is charged on purchases made so, essentially, short-term credit is granted without the consumer paying any interest. \r\n\r\nAmong its many features it provides:\r\n1. Access to unsecured credit (no collateral required against amounts charged) \r\n2. Interest-free payment from time of purchase to the end of the billing period \r\n3. Instant payment of purchases, allowing for instant receipt of goods and services \r\n4. 24/7 access \r\n5. Fraud protection \r\n\r\nHowever before you decide to use your credit card, carefully consider all of the factors and weigh them against your personal needs and values.\r\n\r\nWhat about credit card control?\r\nHandling money and credit cards wisely is a talent few of us are born with. But it is a skill that can easily be learned. The place to start is with budgeting. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Budget?\r\nIt\'s simply an organized way of managing your finances, basically, it gives you an overall picture of where your money is coming from, when it\'s coming in and how it\'s being spent. A budget should be flexible, changing according to your circumstances.\r\n\r\nBudgeting helps us achieve short-term goals like paying the monthly bills on time; it\'s also for longer-term financial goals like buying a home, a car, paying for an education, \r\na wedding or a holiday. When you take control of your financial affairs, you\'re more confident about the future. \r\n\r\nA budget is key to financial control. It gives you a \"Polaroid picture\" of where you stand financially and where you\'re heading. \r\n\r\nCredit card control tips\r\nUse a low or no-fee credit card and save on the annual fee that some companies charge.\r\n\r\nOnly charge to your credit cards what you can pay off in full when the bill comes.\r\n\r\nYou might not use your credit card as much if you start believing that you have to pay off your entire balance at the end of each month.\r\n\r\nA good way to help to reduce what you pay on your credit card is to search for a card with a lower interest rate. Many financial institutions now offer at least one of these types of cards. \r\n\r\nRemember that when you take a cash advance on your credit card, the interest starts accumulating immediately and not on the due date of your credit card bill. \r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that if you make only the minimum monthly repayment you may never get out of debt.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe main advantage of having a credit card is convenience but if you\'re not good at budgeting and managing your finances, the over-use of credit cards can leave you with a debt that\'s very difficult to pay back.', 'http://www.articlealley.com', 'Business'),
(3, 'Advantages and Disadvantages of Advertising', 'Advertising is the name given to the process of commercial promotion of goods and services in order to increase its sales. Advertising can be done by means of a number of mediums like television, newspapers, wall paintings, billboards, magazines, Internet, by the word-of-mouth and in many other ways. Advertising informs the buyers about the availability of a certain product or service in the market and encourages them to buy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of advertising are:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Increasing the usage of a certain product and hence acquiring more orders. \r\n* Creating new customers and increasing brand recognition.\r\n* To obtain feedback from customers regarding a certain product. \r\n* To indicate introduction of new products or replacement of old ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertising has a number of uses. Apart from promoting commercial goods, advertising can also be used to educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues such as AIDS, deforestation, family planning, etc. It is a powerful media which is capable of reaching to the far out masses. Now a days we find many ads on the internet also. These ads in most cases, have been successfully in connecting the user with the information he requires. To prevent complete commercialization of electronic media, some countries have made it mandatory for broadcasters to air some advertisements related to consumer interest. These public advertisements educate people of that country on a number of social and moral issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, some people are very keen on exposing the negative side of advertising. The impact that advertisements cause depends on the state of mind of an individual and his past experiences. For instances, young kids will be easily attracted by the false claims made in advertisements. People are also arguing about the increase in consumption of substances like alcohol and cigarettes after viewing the ads. Excessive advertising has become a nuisance in most cities of the world. Manufacturers easily make false claims about any product and influence the minds of the people. To confront this problem, companies are being asked to withdraw any false and negative claims made in their ads and also being made to pay a fine for these false claims.', 'http://vincentplatania0.articlealley.com', 'News'),
(4, 'IT Security - Incident Response', 'Incident response is quite simply an organised and procedural approach to reacting to and managing the aftermath caused by a cyber-attack or data breach of a security system. Having already been the victim of an attack and likely suffered data loss or damaged or corrupt technical equipment such as servers, applications and associated devices; the priority for incident response is to manage the situation in such a way as to limit further damage and to reduce recovery and maintenance time and costs.\r\n\r\nCyber-attacks can be incredibly costly for companies with an average direct financial loss of $3.5million to the affected company in terms of data loss, loss of customers, damage to reputation and fines incurred by legal and regulatory institutions. This is why proper IT security management and incident response are so crucial to companies, especially those which rely heavily on IT systems.\r\n\r\nIncident response teams are normally comprised of technicians drawn from within the company or the help of independent security consultancy services may be sought. Either way, an organisation’s incident response team usually work in conjunction with representatives from human resources, legal and public relations departments in order to establish the level of damage caused the source of the security breach and how it can most efficiently be rectified.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry this out response teams employ the SANS Institute’s 6 step procedure the first of which is Preparation; whereby they attempt to educate users and staff as to the importance of updated security measures and how to employ them correctly. The next is Identification, whereby the team must establish whether an event is in fact a security incident; this is done with the help of automated technologies which track internet security activity and computer activity. They then move to the Containment phase, and disconnect all affected systems to prevent any incident from spreading further. Eradication then takes place as the team investigates the origin of the incident and removes all traces of malicious code after which the Recovery phase aims to restore data and software existing on the system. Lastly the team considers Lessons Learned; and analyses how the incident was handled, making recommendations as to how it could be made better in response to future incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a long-winded approach to managing a security breach however when we consider the potential monetary loss such a breach could result in, investment in either an in house or free-lance response team seems like a good one.', 'www.articlealley.comsc', 'Science'),
(5, 'IT Services are the best choice', 'Do you remember a time that the phone service near the Houston area was a diabolical enemy that nickeled and dimed customers for every last penny of their revenue? In those days, corporate phone systems were frequently ridiculously costly and only the big, important companies had teleconferencing, voice mail, call waiting, caller ID and other useful services.\r\n\r\nNew and improved cloud technology transformed Cisco operations to create a balanced playing field that offers more affordable pricing, a better variety of benefits and more reliable phone services than ever before. Today, the majority of companies don\'t use the telephone company anymore. Their phone service is delivered by way of the Internet and is part of their in house network. If communication networks go down, businesses in Houston, TX contact their IT support guru to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nUsing a business network for phone service has many rewards. First, having every service on a single network is simple to maintain. Companies just call IT consulting companies in Houston, Texas to get it all up and running. Many competent tech services close to Houston, Texas offer the knowledge and experience to integrate internet telephone systems into the current network architecture. \r\n\r\nA single server for information and phone services makes everything more secure. In addition, it also allows the combination of networking information with the companies\' phone service, combining email, voicemail and contact details into one platform. \r\n\r\nAdvanced features are also utilized on all Cisco business phone appliances. Caller ID, call forwarding, conference calling, call waiting, faxing, email to fax and additional functionality are combined and easy to access. \r\n\r\nLastly, phone calls are less expensive than before and are not restricted by boundaries or location. In many cases, it costs the same amount to talk to someone in Germany as it does to talk to a friend across town.', 'www.articlealley.com', 'Business'),
(6, 'IS AUTOMATION EATING UP JOBS OR CREATING MORE JOBS', 'The objective of this post is to discuss both sides of the coin on the basis of facts and not emotions or sentiments that are particular to any sect.\r\nThese three integral parts of modern human lives have completely revolutionized the human civilization. Take anything and you shall see that somehow it is related to automation, computer and software. In fact, automation is the child of the marriage between hardware and software. Therefore, we shall focus only on automation to take into account the combined effect of the other two.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, automation has empowered human beings to do more meaningful and human-like jobs. Automation has helped us to focus on those qualities that has made us humans – the most unique and intelligent animal to have ever walked on this planet.\r\n\r\nNot only that, automation has taken the responsibility of performing monotonous, tiresome and high precision jobs in a flawless and efficient manner. This has relieved us from doing boring things and we can now indulge in creative pursuits – something which only human beings can do.\r\n\r\nFor example, automation has empowered us to complete the manufacturing and assembly of a car in a few hours, as per the exact technical specification. Assembling units run on a 24x7 basis with tremendous precision, so that human beings can perhaps write a poem or work on an unsolved mathematics problem.\r\nHowever, had the world being a Utopian place where everything is fair and ideal, then automation would have been undoubtedly the greatest boon for mankind. Sadly, it is not so and will never be so in the days to come.\r\n\r\nHuman beings, for their very existence, needs some form of currency that can standardize the mode of exchange. People needs all kind of things, some of them being necessities and some others are luxury. But then again, the classification of the necessities and the luxury items are extremely subjective.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the wealth or currency has not been distributed equally among all. Now, currency being the very basic of modern life, those who have more currency or wealth at their disposal leads better lives and can cope up with changes in a much more effective manner than those who doesn’t have it.\r\n\r\nThe point is that automation has been brought due to industrialization, and industries are driven mostly by the capitalists. Now, there is nothing wrong with capitalism, except the fact that when a capitalist decides to automate his marketing campaigns and brings in software to improve efficiency and increase profit margin, those people who were fully dependent on their salaries and have known sales as the only profession throughout their lives start starving all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we cannot expect a man at his mid-forties to invest substantially on upgrading his employability and skills, when he has at least three mouths to feed. Take for example, telemarketing professionals and professional answering specialists ate up the jobs of thousands of people who were engaged in vis-à-vis sales.\r\n\r\nCheap telephone calls kicked them out of their jobs, because their employer had no way out but to adopt modern technology to stay in business. The scenario is changing again, as the telemarketers are losing their jobs to digital marketing specialists. Employers and employees are merely puppet in the hands of technology driven automation, although we must remember that when one door closes, another one opens up!', 'www.articlealley.com', 'Science');
